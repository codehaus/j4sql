		<p>
		Java is a nearly ideal language for stored prcedures programming:
		<ul>
			<li>portable</li>
			<li>based on open standards</li>
			<li>safe</li>
			<li>fast</li>
			<li>developer-friendly</li>
		</ul>
		
		</p>
		</section>
		<section name="The problem">
		<p>
		Though java bytecode is portable and java stored procedures can operate using standard APIs, until now there was no toolset for developers
		to really use java stored procedures.
		</p>
		<p>
		J4SQL has tools that makes life really easy.
