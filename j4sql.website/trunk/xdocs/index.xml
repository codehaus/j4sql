		<section name="Java Stored Procedures">
		<p>
		Java is a nearly ideal language for stored procedures programming:
		<ul>
			<li>portable</li>
			<li>based on open standards</li>
			<li>safe</li>
			<li>fast</li>
			<li>developer-friendly</li>
		</ul>
		Java as stored procedure language is supported by the most database product: IBM DB2 UDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and others.
		</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Why J4SQL?">
		<p>
		Though java bytecode is portable and java stored procedures can operate using standard APIs, until now there was no toolset for developers
		to really use java stored procedures.
		</p>
		<p>
		J4SQL generates DDLs out of your doclet tags and/or annotations.
		</p>
		<p>
		J4SQL is an effort to make the life of java stored procedure developers really as easy as possible. J4SQL is 100% free for both open source and commercial developement.
